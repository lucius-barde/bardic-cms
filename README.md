# opcms v2.3
 
OppidumCMS, with Docker compatibility.

OppidumCMS (alias OpCMS) is a small, lightweight, single-table content management system (CMS) optimized for APIs with a frontend layer and an admin dashboard. OppidumCMS is based on Slim PHP framework and Twig, and all objects of any type in an OppidumCMS website share the same structure. OppidumCMS uses Markdown for rich-text content, and JSON for custom parameters and modules.

OpCMS is developed by the one-man team Carte Blanche Web Development (cbwebdev) and is in final development.

**OppidumCMS features:**
- Ultra-lightweight (including few dependencies)
- Single-table
- MVC architecture
- Frontend engine with built-in URL rewriting
- Multilingual ready
- Works as a Web-Service (can be implemented in separate apps, like an API)
- Polymorphic, generic objects: deploy custom modules within minutes
- Both frontend and backend highly customizable (OppidumCMS is a canvas of a CMS)


## Requirements
- A web server, preferably a Linux - Apache - MariaDB - PHP stack.
- Software packages: **git**, **composer**.
- Dependencies installed by composer: slim PHP core, Twig templating engine with some extensions, and PHPMailer.
- Dependencies installed in code: Bootstrap, jQuery, Parsedown, and other modules in /external.

## Installation
- `git clone https://bitbucket.org/cbwebdev/opcms2.git`
- `composer install` in the public folder, to generate the public/vendor folder.
- If using docker: run `docker-compose up`
- copy config.sample.php to config.php
- copy/paste the initial SQL content from config.php to PHPMyAdmin or Adminer
- setup your own configuration in config.php
- create an 'uploads' folder in /public and allow write permissions to your webserver.
- Done ! You generated an OppidumCMS site with a homepage and an admin user. Default credentials are user: admin, password: Qwe12345


## Single-table
- OppidumCMS uses a single table and polymorphic objects (called "blobs") which uses the same fields, be it a page, a paragraph, a media, a user, a custom object, etc.
	- INT(11) id: unique identifier
	- VARCHAR(32) type: object type (i.e. "page", "paragraph", "image", "site" etc.)
	- VARCHAR(128) url: unique resource locator
	- VARCHAR name: human-readable name for the object
	- TEXT content: directly loaded content
	- INT parent: id of parent object
	- INT status: 1=online, 0=offline, -1=deleted
	- INT author: id of user who created the object
	- TIMESTAMP edited: date of last modification
	- VARCHAR lang: language identifier of the resource
	- INT translation_of: id of an object which the object is a translation of
	- TEXT params: all the custom parameters
	
## config.php

### array $config
- bool displayErrorDetails: ?
- bool addContentLengthHeader: ?
- array db: database info
	- string host: database host (e.g. "localhost")
	- string user: database user (e.g. "root")
	- string pass: database password
	- string dbname: database name
	- string tbl: opcmsdev
- string abspath: the site's URL with http(s)://
- string absdir: the site's root path on the server (e.g. /var/www/opcms)
- string template_dir: relative path to the activated template

## index.php

### site constants
- ABSPATH: populated from $config['abspath'] in config.php.
- ABSDIR: populated from $config['abspath'] in config.php.
- TBL: populated from $config['db']['tbl'] in config.php.
- TEMPLATE_DIR: populated from $config['template_dir'] in config.php.

### MVC (model-view-controller)
OppidumCMS uses a model-view-controller architecture based on Slim PHP's routing system.  The process is:

- The called URL will be executed by the controller which handles its route (i.e. /admin by AdminController, /blob by BlobController, etc.)
- The controller executes some code, retrieves some parameters, and pass those parameters either to the view renderer, or to the JSON renderer.
- The view renderer passes all the aforementioned parameters to the root template **standard.html.twig** and executes it. The *action* parameter defines which page / partial template will be loaded.


If you create custom models and controllers, please load them at the bottom of index.php.

## Controllers

## Modules

Modules have default params which are used in create and edit forms, they are indicated in /modules/{module].json.

The list of parameters is documented in each one of the  /modules/{module].json files.

Here are some of the default OppidumCMS modules (this list might be outdated):

- **site:** Site blob is the website's root element, containing site-wide configuration. There should be max. 1 site blob per site.
	- string homelink: the url field of the home page (must be set and changed manually)
	- object languages: the active languages on the website in an object format, where the key is the 2-letter short language identifier, and the value is the human-readable name of the language. Example {"en":"English","fr":"Français"}
	- string default_language: the 2-letter short language identifier for the default language (i.e. "en", "fr", "de", etc.)

- **user:** User blobs handle login info and access rights for the website's users. A fresh install comes with one user called *admin*.
	- int level: the access rights level: "3" is (super)admin privileges, "2" is moderator, "1" is contributor, and "0" is simple user with no editing rights. "-1" (-2,-3...) could be used to handle banned users with different banning reasons.
	- the status field is used for validating or deleting users: "1" is active, "0" is pending (confirm e-mail etc.), and "-1" is for a user who deleted his own account.
	
TODO:  most of the user access rights and stuff are not yet developed.

- **page:** Page blobs are used for displaying pages, and their URL field is automatically used for URL rewriting. OppidumCMS can handle a maximum sub-page depth of 3 levels.
	- unsigned_int order: the numeric order in which pages come in the sitemap.
	- string metaDescription: the <meta name="description" /> tag for search engines.
	- the parent field should be the site blob's ID if a 1st level page, or another page's ID if a subpage.
	- the content field of page blobs should remain empty.

- **paragraph:** Paragraph blobs are simple blocks of text, they are generally children of page blobs.
	- unsigned_int order: the numeric order in which the page content is shown.
	- bool hideTitle: if "0" or false, the paragraph's title won't be displayed.
	
- **image:** Image blobs contain a reference to a file in the /uploads folder, and other parameters. They are generally children of page blobs.
	- unsigned_int order: the numeric order in which the page content is shown.
	- string src: the part of the access path which follows "/uploads". Example: the parameter must be "/img.jpg" for an image located at {ABSDIR}/uploads/img.jpg, or "/subfolder/img2.jpg" for an image located at {ABSDIR}/uploads/img2.jpg.
	- string class: the class="" parameter for the <img /> tag. Include all the classes as you would do in HTML, example: "figure-img img-fluid rounded".
	- bool caption: displays (or not) the image in a <figure> tag with a <figcaption> containing both the title and the description (name and content fields).
	
- **block** A block displayed on several pages, for example, in a banner. Can contain paragraphs and other content.

- **csv** A CSV parser. Only uses a controller with 2 routes

- **form:** A simple contact form
	- int order: order on the page
	- email mailto: the destination address
	- string subject: message title (not used, probably for multilingual?)
	- number nonce: an optional custom number to strengthen the antispam field.
	- object delivery: contain the success and error messages (^not used, probably for multilingual?)
	
- **gallery** An image gallery
	- int order: order on the page
	- string format: the CSS classes on the elements (i.e. "col-md-3", "col-md-4 col-sm-6"...)
	- string folderBase: the folder name (i.e. "galleries/gal1" for /uploads/galleries/gal1)
	
- **html:** Custom HTML block
	- unsigned_int order: the numeric order in which the page content is shown.
	- bool hideTitle: if "0" or false, the paragraph's title won't be displayed.
	
- **map:** A map with a single marker and popup, using leaflet.js
	- int order: order on the page
	- float lat: latitude
	- float lng: longitude
	- int zoom: default zoom (1-20)
	- string popupText: content of the popup text
	- bool popupOpened: whether popup is opened or closed on page load
	
	

## Pseudo-blobs ##

- **_opcms_error** This "bogus" blob type is not present in the database, it's only shown in Sitemap as an error handler to display an invalid blob. For example: if there is twice the same value for order in some page's content. To be documented.

	
## Base template
OppidumCMS's base template is a minimalist display of all the parameters, and is mostly suitable for development or debugging purposes. You should consider creating your own new template.

### standard.html.twig ###
This file is the base template, from <html> to </html>, called on every page. The dynamic content is provided by the various Controllers who give these parameters to the Twig template engine. The main parameters are:
- action: a string that requires which partial templates will be loaded. It is used for admin and user login pages. If no action is provided, then the basic frontend template will likely be loaded.
- object session: contains the $_SESSION data.
- object site: contains the site blob's data.
- object blob: if a single element is shown (i.e. a page, an article, etc.) then the 
- object elements: if several elements are shown
- string status: if a status message is shown, contains the status class (i.e. "success", "warning", "error", etc.)
- string statusText: if a status message is shown, contains the details.
- object sitemap: contains the whole site hierarchy, can be used to show the main navigation menu.
- bool isHome: true if is home page

### headlinks.html.twig and bodylinks.html.twig ###
These two files contain the link, meta, or script tags that must be present either in header or footer. Put your CSS and JS here.

### Admin views of base template ###
All the admin-{...}.html.twig and user-{...}.html.twig are called by standard.html.twig, instead of the frontend template, depending on the action. 

### Module views ###
OppidumCMS uses templates named after the modules that are "pageElement"s , like paragraph.html.twig for paragraphs,  image.html.twig for image blobs, etc.
The standard.html.twig calls the different module templates when necessary, but if you create new modules you must add manually your new blob type in the page content's inclusion list. The default template plainly displays the blob.name and the blob.content for unknown blob types or blob types not added in the inclusion list.

## Admin template
OpCMS can use a separate admin theme, or the same theme as frontend. By default no admin theme is provided and admin pages are on the same theme as the frontend, but activating $container->viewAdmin instead of $container->view can activate the admin theme renderer.

## Others
### /public/external and /public/css folders:
Contains external libraries used globally, independently from the theme. This should be cleaned and put in the frontend theme or admin theme.
